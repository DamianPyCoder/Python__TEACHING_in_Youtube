# PYTHON LESSONS

## 1. Getting started 
#### 1.1 - Python Installation

:computer: Windows

- Go to the official Python website, https://www.python.org/downloads/, and download the latest Python installer for Windows.
- Run the installer, and select the "Add Python to PATH" option. This will ensure that you can run Python from any directory in the command prompt.
- Choose the installation directory, and click on "Install Now".
- Wait for the installation to finish. This may take a few minutes.
- Once the installation is complete, open the command prompt and type "python" to verify that Python has been installed correctly.

:computer: Linux

- Open a terminal window.
- Update the package list with the command "sudo apt-get update".
- Install Python by typing "sudo apt-get install python3" (or "python" if you prefer Python 2).
- Wait for the installation to finish. This may take a few minutes.
- Once the installation is complete, type "python3" (or "python" if you installed Python 2) in the terminal window to verify that Python has been installed correctly.

```
Note: 
  The above instructions assume that you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution such as Ubuntu.
  If you are using a different distribution, the commands may vary slightly.
```


#### 1.2 - Git & Github

- Create a project on GITHUB and copy the link

- Create a folder on your system, open a terminal and situate inside the folder. Attention, in this folder we will put all the code that we want to upload.

- In the terminal type the command ```GIT CLONE``` +"address of the repository"

- To know what state the files are in and see if they are still to be uploaded, we will put in command: 
```diff 
GIT STATUS
```

- In case we want to upload a file we will use the command: ``` GIT ADD ``` "file name"

- If you want to upload ALL the files, the name is replaced by a period: 
```diff 
GIT ADD .
```

- We add a commit that specifies that we have uploaded, for example we will call it First Commit: 
``` diff
GIT COMMIT -m "First Commit" 
```

- We upload the files: 
```diff 
GIT PUSH
```
